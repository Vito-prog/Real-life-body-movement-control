# 🕹️ Real-life Body Movement Control using Computer Vision

A real-time gesture-based control system that tracks human body movements through webcam input using computer vision. The goal is to simulate physical interaction with machines by detecting key body positions and triggering responses based on specific gestures.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect human body posture and movement in real-time  
- Identify key body gestures (e.g. hand raising)  
- Trigger custom actions when a gesture is recognized  
- Demonstrate the potential for gesture-based interfaces

## 📁 Input Data

- Live video feed from webcam  
- Detected body landmarks (pose estimation) using MediaPipe  
- No external dataset required

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3  
- OpenCV – for webcam video processing  
- MediaPipe – for pose and landmark detection  
- NumPy – for calculations on landmark coordinates

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Capture real-time webcam video  
2. Detect key body points (shoulders, elbows, wrists)  
3. Monitor positions to identify gestures  
4. Execute logic if certain gesture conditions are met

## 🔍 Examples of Gesture Triggers

- Raise right hand above right shoulder → Trigger Action A  
- Raise both hands → Trigger Action B  
- Hand crossing the body → Trigger Action C

## 📈 Applications

- Contactless user interfaces  
- Motion-controlled games  
- Smart home gesture controls  
- Assistive tech for people with physical impairments  
- Real-time interaction in virtual/augmented reality

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- Add hand gesture classification (e.g. thumbs up, swipe)  
- Control external apps (e.g. Spotify, smart lights)  
- Integrate audio feedback or voice assistant support  
- Build GUI overlay for visual feedback
