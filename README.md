📌 Real-life Body Movement Control
A project that simulates real-life body movement detection and control using computer vision techniques. It captures human body motion via a webcam and translates it into interactive responses.

🎯 Features
Real-time body detection using Mediapipe

Tracks specific body landmarks (e.g., hands, arms)

Detects user movement and triggers corresponding actions

Potential use cases: gesture-controlled interfaces, fitness apps, virtual games

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

OpenCV

Mediapipe by Google

NumPy

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Vito-prog/Real-life-body-movement-control.git
cd Real-life-body-movement-control
2. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not available, manually install:

bash
Copy
Edit

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

3. Run the main script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Make sure your webcam is connected and accessible.

📷 How it works
The project uses Mediapipe's pose and hand tracking modules to detect body landmarks. Based on predefined conditions (e.g. hand above shoulder), specific actions are triggered, such as printing a command or changing system states.

You can modify the logic in main.py to adapt it for other gesture-based applications.

📈 Future Improvements
Add UI overlay for better user feedback

Map gestures to control hardware (e.g. Arduino, smart lights)

Add support for multiple gesture patterns

Export gesture data to CSV for machine learning training
